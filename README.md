# LeaphyAI
This project is coded in Python version 3.7

In this project we create a robot that competes in the [RoboCup Junior](https://www.robocupjunior.nl) "Redded Basis" league using exclusively Neural Networks.
We will simulate a lot using pygame to make the learning process much easier for the neural network, it might be less accurate this way though.
